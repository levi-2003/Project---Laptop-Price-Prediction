# Project---Laptop-Price-Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the price of a laptop based on several key features provided by the user. The prediction model was trained using a dataset of over 1300 laptops, refined through feature engineering, and optimized using Gradient Boosting algorithms. The web application was developed using Streamlit to provide an intuitive interface for users to input laptop specifications and receive price predictions in real-time.
